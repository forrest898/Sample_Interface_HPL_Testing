These results were taken after I discovered that using anything other than precise_ip=0 disturbs reading the counters via PERF_SAMPLE_READ. In each of the "Value: " fields under PERF_SAMPLE_READ, the results are garbage unless precise_ip is set to 0. Samples have been collected for precise_ip=0,1,2 using test_events and a matrix multiply routine for testing. perf_event_open failed for all events where precise_ip=3.
